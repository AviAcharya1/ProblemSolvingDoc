                    <div class="content">
                        <li><strong></strong>Definition: The two pointers technique involves using two pointers (indices) to traverse a data structure, such as an array or a linked list, in a specific manner to solve a problem.</li>
                        <li><strong></strong>The pointers are initialized to different positions within the data structure, and they are moved according to specific rules or conditions to achieve the desired result.<li>

                    <div class="content">
                        <li>When the problem involves processing pairs of elements or finding a relationship between elements within a data structure.</li>

                        <li>The time complexity of two pointers algorithms is typically O(n), where n is the size of the input data structure, as the pointers generally traverse the data structure once or a few times.</li>
                        <li>Space complexity is usually constant or proportional to the size of any auxiliary data structures used, as the two pointers technique typically does not require significant additional memory.</li>
